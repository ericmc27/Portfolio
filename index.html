    <p>
      Hi, my name is Eric Castillo, and I'm one of the most curious people you'll ever meet.
      Growing up around a father who had created his own invoicing software and had already been selling it before
      I was born, I was given the chance to tinker with computers and technology from an early age.
    </p>

    <p>
      Curiosity quickly became a driving force in my life. My brothers and I would constantly ask our father questions—not
      just about his software, but about any technology-related topic we could think of.
      This early habit of questioning and exploring laid the foundation for my research and problem-solving skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated from Westchester Community College before transferring to Mercy University, where I earned an associate's degree and a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity.
      Along the way, I built practical experience through applied coursework, laboratory work, technical bootcamps, and hands-on projects.
      I also worked twice as a tutor, supporting students in computer programming and cybersecurity courses,
      which strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts and mentor others. I assist my father at times in his small business,
      acting as the go-to resource for technology-related tasks and providing support in customer service as needed
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a foundational background in technology, with exposure to cybersecurity, full-stack software development, and team-based projects. I'm a fast learner who enjoys research
      and technical problem-solving, and I'm seeking my first technical role where I can continue to develop
      and strengthen my skills while growing professionally.
